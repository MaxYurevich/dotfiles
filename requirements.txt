## REQUIREMENTS ##

There is a list of some requirements for my dotfiles. 
I did not write installation script because different operation systems has different package managers and I am too lazy for common script. 
There are no guarantees that I have not forgotten anything ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Installation:
You can try install it all with your package manager (yaourt -S `cat ./flat-requirements.txt`).
Some dependencies install equally on all unix-like systems (make download-deps).

Main packages:
* zsh (should be default shell)
* git

Plugins managers:
* oh-my-zsh [ sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)" ]

Dependencies:
* powerlevel10k [ https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k ]
